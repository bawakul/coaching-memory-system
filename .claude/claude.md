## Session Tracking

After each session, write session notes in `Sessions/YYYY-MM-DD-description.md`. **Ask for permission** before writing session notes to avoid overdoing it. Session notes help track progress and maintain context across sessions.

## Date Format Guidelines

When working with dates in this project:

- **Session filenames**: Use `YYYY-MM-DD-description.md` format (machine-sortable)
- **Frontmatter dates**: Use ISO format `YYYY-MM-DD` (for scripts and queries)
- **Display dates**: Use wiki links `[[DD MMM YYYY]]` (e.g., `[[03 Nov 2025]]`) for human-readable, Obsidian-linked dates
- **Session frontmatter**: Include these fields:
  ```yaml
  ---
  date: YYYY-MM-DD
  project: project-name
  type: session
  claude-generated: true
  tags: [session, planning/implementation/decision]
  ---
  ```

This ensures consistency across the portfolio and enables Obsidian cross-referencing.
